# Case File: Scientific-Method-Framework (SMF) 🔬

> **"My professor friend was at his wit's end. 'They're all using AI,' he complained, 'and the worst part is the AI doesn't even cite the sources. It just makes them up. And the students don't even bother to check before handing it in!'**
>
> **Suddenly, I saw a problem everyone faces except maybe the professor. It wasn't just about cheating; it was about the fundamental erosion of truth by confident, hallucinating machines.**
>
> **So I built the Scientific Method.**
>
> **It's a structured approach to experimentation for software development. It transforms AI from a confident generator into a rigorous researcher. Before a claim is made, it must survive the gauntlet: Hypothesis → Research → Synthesis."**

## 🏛️ FORENSIC SUMMARY: The Academic Integrity Pillar
The SMF is a high-fidelity **Epistemological Substrate** designed to solve the "Stochastic Parrot" problem. It forces AI agents out of "Inference Mode" and into a "State of Doubt." Before an agent utters a word, it must treat its intuition as a hypothesis that requires empirical validation.

### 🧠 The Methodology
1. **Student Claim (Hypothesis)**: Every AI output starts as an unverified claim.
2. **Citation Verifier (Research)**: The framework queries real-world databases (Crossref, arXiv) to find *actual* supporting evidence.
3. **Grounding Check (Hermeneutics)**: It calculates a "Salience Score"—if the evidence doesn't exist or doesn't support the claim, the "Truth" is rejected.

## ⚙️ Core Components
- **`src/research.py`**: The ResearchAgent (The Librarian).
- **`src/core/hermeneutics.py`**: The Contextual Anchor (The Grader).
- **`src/main.py`**: The Truth Synthesizer (The Proofreader).
