# Scientific-Method-Framework (SMF) 🔬

> **"The Last Line of Defense Against Stochastic Parrots."**

The Scientific-Method-Framework (SMF) is a high-fidelity **epistemological substrate** designed to transform AI from a confident hallucinatory generator into a rigorous research discipline. 

## 📜 The Narrative: The Professor's Revenge
The SMF solves the "Academic Arms Race" by forcing AI agents out of "Inference Mode" and into a "State of Doubt." Before an agent utters a word, it must treat its intuition as a hypothesis that requires empirical validation.

## 🏛️ Architecture: The Truth Operating System

### 🔍 1. Hypothesis Layer (`core/hermeneutics.py`)
Implementation of the **Contextual Anchor**. This layer ensures the AI isn't just "consistent" but "grounded." It weighs internal formal logic (Z3) against external reality data-streams.

### 🛡️ 2. Credibility Engine
Strict **Source Sovereignty** ensures that citations only come from verified academic (.edu, .gov) and institutional databases. 

### ⚡ 3. Sub-Millisecond Integrity
Architected for performance. Leveraging probabilistic verification to ensure high-fidelity audits without bottlenecking the agent's utility.

## ⚙️ Substrate Workflow
1. **Inquiry**: AI generates a `Raw Claim`.
2. **Suspension of Belief**: The claim is tagged as `UNVERIFIED`.
3. **Active Research**: Heuristic engines query real-world databases (Crossref, arXiv).
4. **Hermeneutic Evaluation**: The `Contextual Anchor` validates the claim's salience.
5. **Verified Conclusion**: Only then is the "Truth" synthesized for the user.

## 🚀 Phase 3 Transition: Generative Autonomy
We are moving from **Corrective** sanitization to **Generative** autonomy. The SMF is the driver for the next generation of safe, novel AI solutions.
