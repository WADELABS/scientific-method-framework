# Design Decisions: Scientific Method Framework

### Objective: Agentic Provenance & Cryptographic Integrity

- **Decision 1: Merkle-Tree Anchoring**: We chose Merkle-trees over traditional blockchain ledgers to ensure sub-millisecond reasoning latency while maintaining cryptographic finality.
- **Decision 2: Z3 Formal Solver Integration**: Mandatory for hypothesis validation to prevent autonomous agents from contradicting established physical axioms.
- **Decision 3: SLSA-Level 3 Compliance**: Enforced to guarantee that the research artifact supply chain is tamper-proof from inference to publication.
